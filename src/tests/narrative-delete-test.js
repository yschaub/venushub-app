 * Test for Narrative Deletion with Journal Entries

    setup: `
    1. Log in to the application

    testNarrativeDeletion: `
    1. Navigate to the narrative detail page
    2. Verify the journal entry appears in the narrative
    3. Click the delete button for the narrative
    4. Confirm deletion in the dialog
    5. Verify deletion succeeds without errors
    6. Verify you are redirected to the narratives page
    7. Verify the narrative is no longer in the sidebar
  `,

    verifyJournalEntryPreservation: `
    1. Navigate to Journal Entries page
    2. Verify the journal entry still exists
    3. The entry should be preserved, only the association with the narrative was removed
  `,

    observations: `
    The fix:
    1. First deletes associations in the narrative_journal_entries table
    2. Then proceeds to delete the narrative itself
    3. This prevents foreign key constraint violations
    4. Journal entries are preserved, only their associations with the narrative are removed

/**
 * Implementation details:
 * 
 * In useDeleteNarrative, we now:
 * 1. First delete all records from narrative_journal_entries where narrative_id matches
 * 2. Then delete the narrative itself
 * 3. React Query automatically updates the UI through cache invalidation
