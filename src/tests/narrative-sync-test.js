/**
 * Technical implementation details:
 * 
 * 1. useNarrativesForSidebar and useCategoriesForSidebar hooks fetch data with React Query
 * 
 * 2. The mutation hooks (useCreateNarrative, useUpdateNarrative, useDeleteNarrative)
 *    invalidate appropriate queries on success
 * 
 * 3. React Query automatically refetches invalidated queries, keeping the sidebar up-to-date
 * 
 * 4. No page reloads are necessary, improving user experience
