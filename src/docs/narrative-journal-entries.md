# Enhanced Narrative Journal Entry Display

## Overview

This update enhances the narrative viewing experience by displaying full journal entries directly in the narrative view, instead of just showing entry previews with "View entry" links. The implementation matches how entries are shown in the Journal Entries section, including full content, tags, and interactive annotations.

## Key Components

1. **Content Parser Utility**
   - Created `src/utils/contentParser.ts` to handle parsing HTML content and formatting annotations for display
   - Processes annotation markers in the HTML to make them interactive

2. **Annotation Tooltip Component**
   - Created `src/components/AnnotationTooltip.tsx` to display annotation content when hovering over highlighted text
   - Shows annotation content and creation timestamp

3. **Journal Entry Card Component**
   - Created `src/components/JournalEntryCard.tsx` as a reusable component for displaying journal entries
   - Used in both the Journal Entries section and Narrative view for consistency
   - Features:
     - Entry title and creation date
     - Full formatted content with interactive annotations
     - Tags display with appropriate styling
     - Edit button for quick navigation to edit the entry

4. **Updated Narrative Show Component**
   - Enhanced the journal entries fetch to include:
     - Tags for each entry
     - Annotations with their content and metadata
   - Full display of journal entry content using the JournalEntryCard component
   - Properly processes annotation marks to make them interactive

## Technical Improvements

1. **Data Fetching**
   - Now fetches complete journal entry data including annotations
   - Uses the `narrative_journal_entries` junction table to find entries associated with the narrative

2. **Content Processing**
   - Processes HTML content to enhance annotation markers with proper attributes
   - Applies styling to make annotations visually distinct and interactive

3. **User Experience**
   - Users can now read full journal entries without leaving the narrative view
   - Annotations are interactive, showing tooltips on hover
   - Entry tags are visible, making it easier to understand the context of each entry
   - Edit button provides quick access to modify entries

## How It Works

1. When a narrative is viewed, the system fetches all associated journal entries
2. For each entry, it fetches full content, tags, and annotations
3. Annotations in the HTML content are processed to be interactive
4. Entries are displayed using the JournalEntryCard component, which handles:
   - Rendering the content with proper formatting
   - Processing annotation interactions
   - Displaying tags
   - Providing edit functionality

This enhancement significantly improves the narrative viewing experience by providing complete information within the same view, eliminating the need to navigate between pages to read journal entries.
